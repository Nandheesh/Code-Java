 Climbing Stairs 
You are climbing a staircase. It takes n steps to reach the top.
Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

Input: n = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: There are two ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step
2. 2 steps

Example 2:
Input: n = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: There are three ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step + 1 step
2. 1 step + 2 steps
3. 2 steps + 1 step

Explain : It is basically in fibonacci pattern

class Solution {
    public static void main(String[] args){
        int n = 2;
        if(n == 1)
            return 1;
        int num1 = 1;
        int num2 = 2;
        for(int i=3 ;i<=n ;i++){
            int temp = num1;
            num1 = num2;
            num2 = temp+num2;
         }
         System.out.print(num2);
     }
 }
